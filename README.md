 ### Library Database Manager
 This Project reads in data from a SQL database and displays it in table format on the page.
 
 Users can click on the title to go to the Edit page. They can edit the title, author, genre, or year and the save the changes. The book can also be deleted from this page.

 Users can also enter a new book to the database but must fill out all the required fields.
